# WebsiteScreensaver
Website screensaver based on Awesomium for awesome screensavers !

## How to install
Download one of the releases, right click on the *.scr file and choose "Install". Configure it and you're ready to go !

### Dependencies
This project uses Awesomium. I'm not totally sure how to include the dependencies so for now they're side-by-side with the app but they could be needed somewhere else.
